      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>After highschool I took time away from the education system and decided to get a job so to see what the real world felt like. I quickly realized that working dead-end jobs with not future was not going to work for me. This meant it was time for me to go to college, so I attened Harrisburg Area Community College to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. 2 years later I was fed up with taking pointless classes that wouldn't help me with my career and the worst part was I was paying money for them. I then dropped out of college to be apart of Lambda school where I will become a Web Devloper.</p>
